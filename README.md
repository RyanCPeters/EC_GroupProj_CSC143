A repository for students from North Seattle College's CS143 class, spring of 2017, to practice collaborative project design and implementation. It taught us a lot, but didn't see much actual developement considering how junior we were at the time.

This project was used as a means to demonstrate certain concepts that did not make immediate sense when presented in class due to a lack of exmples or demonstrations that are easily relatable to students.

As such, we was the basis for understanding the process of developing a program from concept to code. However, it was always a low priority next to coursework and credited extra curricular activities. That said, this project was a very helpful tool in developing an understanding for encapsulation, and modularization of a project that required more than simply designing a sorting algorithm or making a window with buttons.
