This is where we will create our initial GUI components for the project. I assume that this folder will consist mainly of javax.swing components. But that doesn't mean other options are off limits. However, for the sake of keeping experimental ideas seperate from what should be our solid working code, I would advise creating a new separate module under either Scribble or this View folder. That way we can be sure our naming conventions aren't at risk of unexpected influences.
